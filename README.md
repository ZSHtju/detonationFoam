# detonationFoam_V2.0 (based on OpenFOAM 8): An open-source solver for simulation of gaseous detonation based on OpenFOAM
The description of the governing equations and mathematical models can still be found in the documentation under the version 1.0 branch.

## What's new?
1. Optimized the code structure (A new dictionary file named ‘solverTypeProperties’ has been added under the constant directory of the case folder to select the solver type, replacing the approach in version 1.0 where three separate solvers were compiled).

3. Fixed an initialization error in the turbulence model.

4. Modified the selection strategy for reconstructed variable members in convective flux computation (showing improved performance in supersonic combustion ramjet simulations).

## Directory structure

   solverTypeEuler (Solve Euler equations)  
   solverTypeNS_Sutherland (Solve N-S equations; transport parameters are calculated according to Sutherland model)  
   solverTypeNS_mixtureAverage (Solve N-S equations; transport parameters are calculated according to mixture-averaged model)  
   fluxSchemes_improved (Improved convective flux computation library)

## Compiling 
1. Install OpenFOAM version 8

2. Compile detonationFoam_V2.0
   ```
   cd detonationFoam_V2.0
   ./Allwmake
   ```

Note: If you want to use the mixture-averaged transport model in detonationFoam, you will need additional files that define the transport properties of each species. Please refer to https://github.com/ZSHtju/reactingDNS_OpenFOAM for guidance on how to generate these files.

## Applications
Since detonationFoam solver released on Github, it has been successfully applied in simulation of detonation, scramjet, reactive boundary layer. Here are some typical examples.

### Scramjet; Turbulent boundary layer
The simulation of the scramjet was completed in collaboration with Mr. Menglei Li (PhD candidate) from the National University of Defense Technology.  
The simulation of the turbulent boundary layer was completed with the assistance of Mr. Xin Li (PhD candidate) from National University of Defense Technology.
